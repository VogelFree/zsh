The path in the .zshrc file is mapped to a a specific path where to clone. Use the following command to clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/VogelFree/zsh.git zsh-config
```

Afterwards the script link.sh can be used to integrate this repository to the user configuration.

``` bash
./link.sh
```
